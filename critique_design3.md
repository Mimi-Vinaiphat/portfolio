#The story / Description of the graph
This graph was part of the report about the life insurance industry in thailand. This one was aiming to show and compare 
between the direct premium for each of the life insurance; hence the label from the right table (PA_MAIN, RIDER, etc)
The reason I purposely choose this graph is because the data is about the insurance industry that I would be working once I go back. 
However, this graph has both pros and cons and there are some areas that are confusing and hard to understand.
I hope that after doing this class, I could help make a better visualization using the technique I learn in this course.
<br/>

#In this part, I will critique on the graph using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile.
<br/>
## Usefulness and Completeness (8/10, 8/10)
The graph is quite useful for those who are in the life insurance industry. It did tells you about the direct premium of each life insurance product, 
comparison between each time period (year-to-date), both in terms of value and the percentage changed. 
However, it might take times trying to understand all the details and information presented. Personally I think that the graph and charts presented TOO MUCH information.
Not all the information has to be presented such as the line above the graph as it made some confusion on what it represent. 
I also think that we may not need to show the historial data dated back to 2019 as this created too much bar to compare.
This could be break down into several graphs which I would be showing in my redesign of the data visualization.
<br/>

## Perceptibility (3/10)
For this section, I think that this graph does not represent the info as good as the previous 2 topics. 
It is quite hard to understand the graph even though you are in the industry, so don't talk about those who have no idea about what the graph is about.
Moreover, if you look closely to the graph, you would see that the grpah shows comparison in quarters. 
At first glance, you would think that Q2 would be the amount of Q2, however, it is not the case. The Q2 data is accumulated from Q1. 
Thus what Q4 represent would be the toal direct premium in the year, not just from October to December. This is really deceptive!
<br/>

## Truthfulness (3/10)
Here, I think it is little bit link back to the perceptibility. 
From graph and table, you would think that there is an increasing trend for every quester as the amount has increased.
But that is not the case, Q2 data is accumulate from Q1, Q3 is also from Q2. Therefore, it would always be an increasing trend.
This could mislead the audience. I feel that either it should say something about this, or just show the premium amount in each Q2.
<br/>

## Intuitiveness (5/10)
This one is a bit difficult. For those in the insurance industry, the graph and tables are very to read and interpret as all the terms are used in the work. 
Not only that, all the labels, terminology are what we see everyday at work. 
However, for those who are not in the industry, everything would not make any sense as there is no instructions and description. 
Both graph and tables can convey all the information presented but personally, they may be too much. 
Audiences are bombbarded with information, that some are not useful i.e. the line line above the bar.
<br/>

## Aesthetic (3/10)
The graph are quite hard and not atractive, especially for those who has no interested in the first place.
Like I have already mentioned, the whole thing could break dwon into many graphs so audiences do not feel that they have to get everything at once.
The quarter could break down into each separate graphs. The types of products could be group together based on the main group.
<br/>

## Engagement (4/10)
This graph would inspire the main audience to talk and share about data presented with those in the same company or industry. 
Increase in direct premium means thatthere are many products in that type and that could signal the product trend in the future.
However, for those who not thie main target, these graph would bore them to death!
<br/>

## What missed from the critique?
I thinkthat this method is great in terms of reviewing the data completeness, 
how well audience can take things out from the visualization which at first I would not think about this area. 
However, with this method, it does not take into account of the layout, the color, the font like in other assignments we have to do. 
Based on the original chart, I would tone down the color. 
I cannot change the whole color theme as I have just realized that it is the companyâ€™s color scheme. 
I would print out the title in bold black, unlike the original that used the gold with blue background as it takes out too much of the attention from the graph. 
I think that I will take out the tables and present only the graph as you can see the information from the graph alone (after I redesign the graph)

# So now that we have critqued on how well the graph represent in regards of information, aesthetic, completeness, and also some about color / layout.
We will now redesign the graph!
<br/>
At first I am thinking about separate the graphs into grids of charts, with each chart represnet each time period.
Below would be the first sketch of the graph, in example of the Q4 2021
<br/>![sketch1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112348105/191293705-2f16b564-a92a-4170-9434-bc151d07fd52.png)
<br/>
You can see that there are still too much information in here, even though I have already separate into time period. Some labels have a very small amount.
So I think that maybe we can group them tegether. If the audience would like to know more, they can look up from the orginal sources.
For here, I just would like to show the amount and proportion between each product group.
<br/>
Furthermore, I have decided to take out the line  (trend) which used to show on the of the bar chart. 
I feel that it gives audiences nothing as no label or description on what the line is about.
The line did not match with the table from the left and will create more confusion.
<br/>
As for the color, these colors used are what represent the company, therefore I do not want to change but we can tone down to be in a lighter / pastel tone.
This way we can still keep the color theme but not too strong as those colors (blue/grey/gold) as I feel thta the progonal color theme are too strong and more towards serious information.
<br/>
Inside each portion, % of each group would show inside the pie chart.

# Now after we get the first sketch, I still feel that there are too many information and the graphs look very clustered.
I now group them according to its main group, have label only at the bottom as no need to duplicate as they are used in all the graph.
Ohh, and instead of showing Q2 as cumulative from Q2, I have the Q2 data represent the amount received in Q2 only as I aim to compare the premium received.
In this case, we can also analyze data better i.e. if any seasonal trend in each Q, which Q have most premium so the company can better marketing.
<br/>
So here's the second version!
![sketch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112348105/191294002-04843f16-9956-4a5f-8bd4-815073029911.png)
<br/> Please note that inside the pie chart would be the amount for each product group, and outside would show the proportion (%)

# Now, I ask my friends to have a look and give me feedback, so lets take a look!
<br/> Friend 1: She know what the graphs are about. THere is no confusing or surprising trends. She understands that this grpah is about the proportion / amount of the direct premium for life insurance industry based on each time period. The intended audiences are the insurance companies.
She feels that for pie chart, theres no need to have the axis separated for each chart, I can just show the chart.
However, she would rather use bar chart as to see the trend  as we already know the proportion from the %. 
Using bar chart would make more sense for her. So these are some sketched from her feedback.
<br/> ![friend1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112348105/191294534-55ad2a37-f359-43f8-934b-fd4e5711b406.png)

<br/>
Friend 2: She also understand what the graph is really about and is no surprised or confused by the results. Audiences are either regulator or insurance companies.
She also agrees with the 1st friend that i should not use the pie chart, a bar chart would be better. 
However, she suggests to use the time series to see the trends or seasonality compareing for each products in each time. (stack the groups in each period)
Then add the line (trend) connected between each product groups to see the movement (kinda like the original chart with no table, take out the old line, but then add 3 lines to see the movement) She would also add the amount for each categories in the stack.
<br/> This is what she has in mind.
![friend2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112348105/191295023-f08f1c20-7a95-4638-b2eb-d2d2a45873ac.png)

# After getting all the feedback
I think that I would go with what my friend2 has suggested as she is also working in the similar industry. 

What I plan to redesign for this visualization, audiences can both compare the amount of direct premium for each product type and see the movement trend between eacj time period as well.
You can easily depick that there is seasonal trend for Q2 as for all products, the premium received are always lower than in Q1 (for all year)
Ohh, I have only show 2020 and 2021 as I do not want to overwhelm with data.
I decide to keep with the stack that after consideration, having many grid of charts might be a little hard to understand and compare the data.
I still keep the colors theme (dark blue / gold / grey) as they are OIC's color.
I also change the way data is represented. Instead of using cumulative data i.e. Q3 = Q1+Q2+Q3, the premium for each time period is what they egt during the 3-months time.
Title has been editted to be more clear that its the total premium for life insurance industry only.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to use eith tableau or flourish to recreate from my sketch however, what I get is 2 different graph.
One about the stack bar that compare betweeb each product type within the same time period.
![stack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112348105/191297863-c56f52f2-0b13-4d65-b38a-8d5193a85887.png)

But when I tried to have the line chart to show the movement (trend) change for each product, I cannot get it done.
It always turn out to show the premium amount but thats not what I want.

I want the visualization to look like this!

# All in all, I learn that they way you play with data is important and it is crucial for your visualization to have both completeness or beauty!
