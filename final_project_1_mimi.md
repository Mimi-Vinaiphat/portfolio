# Outline of my final project
## Where has the most dogs in NYC?
For this final project, I am interested in where / which area in NYC that has the most dogs. 
The reason that this could be very helpful is that in SF, they have initiated the pit stop public toilets in 2014 to 
provide the public toilets used and a safe spot to dispose of used needles and bags to dispose dogâ€™s waste.
By identifying the area that has most dogs, we could aim to increase the disposure spot for dog poop, for a clean street.
Ohh one big bonus, we could use this data to see the area where you could meet and play with tons of dogs, happy place for dog lovers!

<br/> So in all, I want to know whereare most dogs located in NYC so that I can try to see where would be the best prime location for putting up dog's disposal station.
<br/>
### Data Used
1. Dog Licensed
Opendata NYC has provided a publicly accessible data regarding with the NYC dog licensing dataset.
All dog owners who live in NYC are required by law to licensed their dogs.
The data is sourced from the DOHMH Dog Licensing System (https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense), where owners can apply for and renew dog licenses. 
<br/> In this dataset, it will tell the dog's name, breed, date of birth. 
Data about the whereabout of the dog (zipcode) is already provided. 
I aim to use the zipcode to map with the NYC area.

2. New York City zipcode list and map
New York Vity has many zipcodes that could be mapped into 5 big borough: Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.
Howover in order to map the zipcode provided in the dog licensing dataset with area, we need another set of information.
From this website (https://bklyndesigns.com/new-york-city-zip-code/) All zipcodes are not only map with borough, they also map within each neighborhood such as East Harlem, Upper West Side, Lower Manhattan etc.

### Sketches of my outline story
Below is what I plan to layout my story.
First I would like to start the introduction that I am really surprised that all dogs need to be licensed by law, because in Thailand, I dont think that dog owner needs to register their dogs.
<br/> Then after found out with the dataset, I feel that there are many things that could be initiate as projects.
<br/> During my internship in NYC, I found out that all dogs owners need to carry needles and bags to pick up dogs poop, as stated by law,
but what if they forget?
<br/> SF has initiated the pit stop publics that offers not only toilet to use, but place to dispose dog's poop too.
So I think that this also could be implemented in NYC as sometimes its hard to find public toilets especially while you are taking your dogs for a walk.
<br/>
Then will show the stats of where are most dogs located~

  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>
<br/>
But beyond that, what else can you also do with the data?
<br/>
See which types of dogs are most owned in NYC

<br/> In which area / zipcode / neighborhood i.e. my favourite dogs are siberian and shiba.

<br/> I will filter only siberian and shiba to see which area has the most of these type!

Best thing, increasing your chances to meet with your favourite kinds of dogs or the flip side, see which types of dogs you would see most in your home area!

### Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand as a flatform to showcase my project which would also be the main program used during my presentation. I saw from examples and feel that as Shortland doesnt come in slides, it might get more attention from the audiences.
<b/r> I would be using tableau to creating my visualization as I need some program that is able to help me map the data in regards to each area.
<br/> I might also use either flourish and canva to create graph like unit chart to show the proportion / ratio of the this particular tyes of dogs with toal numbers of dogs in NYC.
