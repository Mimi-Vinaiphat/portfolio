# Outline of my final project
## Where has the most dogs in NYC?
For this final project, I am interested in where / which area in NYC that has the most dogs. 
The reason that this could be very helpful is that in SF, they have initiated the pit stop public toilets in 2014 to 
provide the public toilets used and a safe spot to discard of used bags to dispose dogâ€™s waste.
By identifying the area that has most dogs, we could aim to increase the disposure spot for dog poop, for a cleaner street.
Ohh one big bonus, we could use this data to see the area where you could meet and play with tons of dogs, happy place for dog lovers!
<br/> So in all, I want to know whereare most dogs located in NYC so that I can try to see where would be the best prime location for putting up dog's disposal station.
<br/>
### Data Used
1. Dog Licensed
Opendata NYC has provided a publicly accessible data regarding with the NYC dog licensing dataset.
All dog owners who live in NYC are required by law to licensed their dogs.
The data is sourced from the DOHMH Dog Licensing System [Dog Licensing System](https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense)., where owners can apply for and renew dog licenses. 
<br/> In this dataset, it will tell the dog's name, breed, date of birth. 
Data about the whereabout of the dog (zipcode) is already provided. 
I aim to use the zipcode to map with the NYC area.
[Dog Licensing Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp/).

2. New York City zipcode list and map
New York City has many zipcodes that could be mapped into 5 big borough: Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.
Howover in order to map the zipcode provided in the dog licensing dataset with area, we need another set of information.
From this website [NYC zipcode and map](https://bklyndesigns.com/new-york-city-zip-code/). All zipcodes are not only map with boroughs, they also map within each neighborhood such as East Harlem, Upper West Side, Lower Manhattan etc.

### Sketches of my outline story
Below is what I plan to layout my story.
First I would like to start the introduction that I am really surprised that all dogs need to be licensed by law, because in Thailand, I don't think that dog owner needs to register their dogs.
<br/>
<br/> Then after found out with the dataset, I feel that there are many things that could be initiate as projects.
<br/> 
<br/>During my internship in NYC, I found out that all dogs owners need to carry bags to pick up dogs poop, as stated by law,
but what if they forget?
<br/>
<br/> SF has initiated the pit stop publics that offers not only toilet to use, but place to dispose dog's poop too.
So I think that this also could be implemented in NYC as sometimes its hard to find public toilets especially while you are taking your dogs for a walk.
<br/> Then will show the stats of where are most dogs located~

  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

<br/>
But beyond that, what else can you also do with the data?
<br/>
See which types of dogs are most owned in NYC
<br/>

<br/> In which area / zipcode / neighborhood i.e. my favourite dogs are siberian and shiba.
<br/> I will filter only siberian and shiba to see which area has the most of these type!

<br/>
Best thing, increasing your chances to meet with your favourite kinds of dogs or the flip side, see which types of dogs you would see most in your home area!
<br/>
So here are some exmaples on what you can do with the data. Still I would like to focus that with this visualization, NYC officers could use this to set up more disposable stops that provides bags to pick up dog's waste. With Less dog's waste on the street, newyorker could have a better environment and less scred of stepping on the poops!

### Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand as a flatform to showcase my project which would also be the main program used during my presentation. I saw from examples and feel that as Shortland doesnt come in slides, it might get more attention from the audiences. 
<br/> I might also use either flourish and canva to create graph like unit chart to show the proportion / ratio of some particular types of dogs with total numbers of dogs in NYC.

### Feedback from class
I have received feedbacks that
<br/> 1. The clear call for action is not clear enough. With this data, I could aim for audiences to increase the disposable stops if the main audiences are the NYC officers. I could also aim to tell the audiences to be mindful for environment, etc.
<br/> 2. I should change the label in Where are the dog visualization. At first since I counted the dog from the name, the label were a bit misleading (count the dog name). I have already changed this to be "Dog Count".
<br/> 3. Rewrite and take out some words that are misleading.
