# Part 3 of my final project
After I have completed the [part 1](https://mimi-vinaiphat.github.io/portfolio/final_project_1_mimi.html) and [part 2](https://mimi-vinaiphat.github.io/portfolio/final_project_2_mimi.html)
In this part 3, I am going to summarize all the steps that I have done so far in order to complete this project.
<br/> The link to the final deliverable is provided [here] ()

## Prior to part 3: Final Deliverables
In part 1, we need to think of what story that we would like to tell, but then you also need to have data to support your stories.
Without data, your story might not be persuasive enough as audiences tend to trust the statistics more than just floating idea.
<br/> I also sketched some rough idea or outline what I planned to include in the story. 
<br/> I think this is very useful as it could help you frame your idea and also explore the dataset that you plan to use as sometime that data might not be usable.
Hence, you would know from this step whether you need more data to support your story or this is enough.
Moreover, in this part, I get to try different visualization tools (flourish / tableau) to play around with data and see which one would give me with the best fit charts.

<br/>
In part 2, after we have some rough idea, now we try to turn it into a story. 
<br/> Even though in this part, we only have to have like s stroyboard, not like th whole draft story, I feel that it helps me a lot when I try to complete draft of the whole project.
This is because next step from creating a storyboard would be having some feedback from the user research.
<br/> Having the whole draft gives the interviewee the whole picture of the story and can get more insightful comments. They can read through the whole story and and give a better feed back that relevant to the next part.
This includes that feedback from classes as well.

## Revision for part 3: Final Deliverable
Therefore in this part, I incorporate all the feedbacks from part 1, part 2, and revise on my draft.
I have included more supportive data regarding the complaints on dogs feces on the street to cement my statement and help raise the awareness of dogs owner. 
Officers who are one of the main targeted audiences could use this supportive graph to show that there are some complaints regarding eith dirty sidewalk made of dog waste. 
And that it is beneficial to install dog disposable stations in area where there are most dogs and/or most complaints.
I have also adjusted some of the word texts to be shorter, more focus. 
Ohh, some parts of the texts are either bold / underline / font colored or mixed to highlight the key takeaways as per the feedback as wells.

## Do I hook this with my audience?
For this project, my target audiences can be divided into 2 big groups.
<br/>   First would be the NYC state department officer who are responsible for the sanitizaing the sidewalks or those who can make decision on the budget allocation. They are one of the main audiences as they would be the people who would make decisions on implementing / installing the dog disposable stations. Therefore, we have to include or visualize some map to show where would be the best areas for the implementation.
<br/>   Second targeted audience would be the dog owners residing in the NYC. With these visualization, they could estimate on where would the stations be and it could lead them to take more dogs over there as they know that there will be some dog disposable stations provided. They could also be reminded that there are some areas that got complaints on dog waste / dirty sidewalk. This could help raise awareness on the cleanliness of the street and bemindful to other pedustrians too.
<br/> 

## What I learned along the way
I think that all the steps / processes that we have done since assignment 1 help shape the storyboard and what I want to include in my final project.
Not only that, when I put on the texts / story, I try to have them coherent with each other, have clear texts and be straightforwards and that comes from critique. 
Feedbacks from classmate, friends, those you ask help a lot in creating and adjusting the stories as they are from people who have no idea on the story. They are not me who knows everything, so sometimes they catches stuff, from an outsiders' views.
