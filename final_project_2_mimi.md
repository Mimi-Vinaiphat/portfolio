# Part 2 of my Final Project
After I have outlined the story in part 1, in this part, we will see the wireframe and storyboard
on how I intend to stell my stories regarding with where are most dogs in NYC and how we can creat a better NYC with the data.

## Wireframe and Storyboard
For this part, please use [this link](https://preview.shorthand.com/jQ89PSvBdl1wMlEL) to access my draft version of my storyboard.
I decide to use shorthand to tell my story as I feel that it would give me flows on my story.

## User Research and Interview
Based on the story that I would like to propose tell, my targeted audiences would be
1. NYC officers who are responsible for taking care of the streets or any department that directly deals with this.
2. Dog owners who walk their dogs as they would be the most who most beneficial for more of the dog disposable stations
3. Those who love to play / see dogs but dont have one for their own, or those foreigners who miss their dog sooo much (Like me)!

<br/>
As there is a bit impossible to interview the NYC officers, I plan to interview 1 person from group 2, and 2 persons from group 3 as my representative.
1st respondant: Dog owner in US, female, mid-twenties
2nd respondant: Female, non-US, own dogs back home
3rd respondant: Female, non-US, do not own a dog but love to play with dogs
<br/>
I have put together the interview scripts and the responses from the interviewees in the tables below.
<br/>
| Script | Responses from 1st | Responses from 2nd | Responses from 3rd
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
