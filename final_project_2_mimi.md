# Part 2 of my Final Project
After I have outlined the story in [part 1](https://mimi-vinaiphat.github.io/portfolio/final_project_1_mimi.html) , in this part, we will see the wireframe and storyboard
on how I intend to stell my stories regarding with where are most dogs in NYC and how we can creat a better NYC with the data.

## Wireframe and Storyboard
For this part, please use [this link](https://preview.shorthand.com/jQ89PSvBdl1wMlEL) to access my draft version of my storyboard.
I decide to use shorthand to tell my story as I feel that it would give me flows on my story.

## User Research and Interview
Based on the story that I would like to propose tell, my targeted audiences would be
1. NYC officers who are responsible for taking care of the streets or any department that directly deals with this.
2. Dog owners who walk their dogs as they would be the most who most beneficial for more of the dog disposable stations
3. Those who love to play / see dogs but dont have one for their own, or those foreigners who miss their dog sooo much (Like me)!

<br/>
As there is a bit impossible to interview the NYC officers, I plan to interview 1 person from group 2, and 2 persons from group 3 as my representative.
1st respondant: Dog owner in US, female, mid-twenties
2nd respondant: Female, non-US, own dogs back home
3rd respondant: Female, non-US, do not own a dog but love to play with dogs
<br/>
I have put together the interview scripts and the responses below
<br/>

Script with responses
1. What do you think of the flow of the story?
<br/> All three respondee understand the message that I try to convey. However, they still think that they are a bit jumpy.
They also say that the second part (where are the most dogs) are a bit too long and kind of irrelevant to the main message.
3rd respondee says that she is not sure whether I should put the bonus (where the dogs are) first before the main message if I would like to mention this as she thinks that the bonus take aways the attention from the key message.

<br/>
2. Can you describe what this is telling you?
<br/> They all can grab the idea that I would like to send the message how it would be better if we can have dog disposable stations. However, the 2nd respondee says that I might need more story to persuade no why the department needs to implement the program. She still doesnt convey or get persuaded enough if shes the officer.
She thinks that it would be more impactful if I could find some evidence of poops on the ground, or any complaints regarding the feces on the street or maybe how bad it would be with them on the ground. 

<br/>
3. Anything you find surprising or confusing?
<br/> 2nd respondee says that she is not sure that I should keep the bonus as it is a bit confusing on why I have included it.
However, she is a bit surprise that most of the dogs are located in 10025 which is in upper west side as she first thought it would be in either Brooklyn / Queens with bigger area to live. Manhattan doesnt have lots of houses as most people live in apartment from what she would guess.

<br/>
4. Anything that you think I need to change, i.e. color, types of graph, typography etc?
<br/> 1st respondee says that shes not sure about the circle graph that I use to show the top 20 of the most dog breed in NYC. She feels that it doesnt really reflect the proportion of the dogs or show the differnt in sizes. Bar chart might be better to show the proportion. 3rd respondee says that the story uses too many pictures and leaves with too much of spaces. She feels that the story could be shorter by grouping text together in some of the slides i.e. text after the blue map.

## Feedback from class
<br/> For the final round of feedback, I have got more suggestions from classmate.
<br/> 1. I could highlight some text that are worth mentioning as they think that as I have quite lots of text, the focus might be off.
<br/> 2. They like the idea that I have put the call to action to the end as it reminds them again on what I am asking for.
<br/> 3. They enjoy going through all photos of doggies!
