<br /> 
My name is Mimi Vinaiphat, a second-year student MSPPM-DA student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I come from Bangkok, a capital city of Thailand. I  earned a BSc in statistics from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. 

<br /> During my summer, I interned at the NAIC as a macropudential risk intern, based in their New York Office. My responsibility was to utilize available data to assess the potential risk to the U.S insurance industry. After graduated, I will be going back to work for the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) as I have received a scholarship from the Royal Thai Government and hope that I could use my knowledge to improve Thailand insurance Industry.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about the technique to visualize data in a better and easier way. Data is all around us, and can tell many stories about it. However, sometimes it is very hard to visualize and summarize these data into a version that everyone can understand and easy to depict. There are tons of data available in the insurance industry and I hope that I can present these meaningful data in a way that those who have no knowledge would understand.
