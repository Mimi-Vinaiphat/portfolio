This is my public portfolio for 94870 Telling Stories with Data

# About me
My name is Mimi Vinaiphat, a second-year student MSPPM-DA student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I come from Bangkok, a capital city of Thailand. I  earned a BSc in statistics from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Prior joining Heinz, I work for the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) which is one of the financial regulator in Thailand, as an insurance product supervisor. OIC is similar to the National Association of Insurance Commissioner (NAIC) in the States.

During my summer, I interned at the NAIC as a macropudential risk intern, based in their New York Office. My responsibility was to utilize available data to assess the potential risk to the U.S insurance industry. After graduated, I will be going back to work for the OIC as I have received a scholarship from the Royal Thai Government and hope that I could use my knowledge to improve Thailand insurance Industry.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about the technique to visualize data in a better and easier way. Data is all around us, and can tell many stories about it. However, sometimes it is very hard to visualize and summarize these data into a version that everyone can understand and easy to depict. There are tons of data available in the insurance industry and I hope that I can present these meaningful data in a way that those who have no knowledge would understand.
