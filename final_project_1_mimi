# Outline of my final project
## Where has the most dog in NYC?
For this final project, I am interested in where / which area in NYC that has the most dogs. 
The reason that this could be very helpful is that in SF, they have initiated the pit stop public toilets in 2014 to 
provide the public toilets used and a safe spot to dispose of used needles and bags to dispose dogâ€™s waste.
By identifying the area that has most dogs, we could aim to increase the disposure spot for dog poop, for a clean street.
Ohh one big bonus, we could use this data to see the area where you could meet and play with tons of dogs, happy place for dog lovers!

### Data Used
Opendata NYC has provided a publicly accessible data regarding with the dog licenses.
In this dataset, it will tell the dog's name, breed, date of birth. 
Data about the whereabout of the dig (zipcode) is already provided. 
I aim to use the zipcode to map with the NYC area.
